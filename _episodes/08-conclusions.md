# Final takeaways

* Requirements gathering and intentional design are indispensable for sustainable software development
* Many books and online resources available for good design principles
* Research software poses additional constraints on design because of its exploratory nature
  * Scientific research software has further challenges
  * High performance computing research software has even more challenges
  * That are further exacerbated by the ubiquity of accelerators in platforms
* Separation of concerns at various granularities\, and abstractions enable sustainable software design
